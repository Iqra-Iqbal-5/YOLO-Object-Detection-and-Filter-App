# YOLO-Object-Detection-and-Filter-App
YOLO-Filter-Detection-App is an interactive desktop application that leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection in images and videos. This app allows users to apply various image filters and perform real-time object detection on images, videos, and live camera feeds. Built using Python and OpenCV, this tool provides an intuitive GUI for easy navigation and use.
# Features
* Object Detection: Detect objects in images, videos, or live camera feeds using the YOLO model.
* Image Filters: Apply a variety of image filters, such as Edge Detection, Sepia, Emboss, and more.
* Live Video Processing: Perform real-time object detection and filtering on live video feeds.
* Easy Configuration: Load custom YOLO weights, configuration, and class names files.
